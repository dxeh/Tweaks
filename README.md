Kerbalism Radial Pressurized tanks and Inline Containers not showing up in your partlist?
With these altered config files the parts will show up in your part list under the "Utility" tab!
Overwrite all config files inside the archive with your "GameData/Kerbalism" folder.

I'm not the creator of the Kerbalism mod, thus should now be credited for it.
I've only found a workaround to active the parts that seem to be deactivated by default.

Credits goes to @Brian Knopp for finding the issue in the first place!
